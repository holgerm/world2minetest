world2minetest is a tool to generate [Minetest](https://www.minetest.net/) worlds based on publicly available real-world geodata. It was inspired by tools such as [geo-mapgen](https://github.com/Gael-de-Sailly/geo-mapgen).

Currently, the following geodata sources are supported. Heightmaps and .dxf CAD files must use the [EPSG:25832](https://epsg.io/25832) coordinate system.
 * Heightmaps in "XYZ ASCII" format
 * [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org), using the [Overpass API](https://overpass-turbo.eu/)
 * .dxf CAD files (trees & bushes only)



Installation
============

 1. Copy this repo's content to your computer, e.g. by cloning:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/FlorianRaediker/world2minetest.git
    ```
 2. Install the required Python modules:
    ```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```



How to use
==========

We offer a [simple guide](SimpleGuide.md) to easy world generation based solely on a apir of coordinates and using only openstreetmap data.

We also offer a [detailed guide](DetailedGuide.md) including the use of heightmaps, openstreetmap data, decorations as well as 3-D data.
